## Using VSCode 
In this tutorial you will learn what VSCode is, why you might want to use it and how you can go about using it.
This is intended as a starting point, from which there are many better resources for advancing your use. 

Below shows an example workspace, highlighting some of the main features of VSCode which make it great.

### **What** is VSCode and **why** would you use it?
- Its a powerful and open source integrated development environment with a graphical user interface (IDE GUI if you will...)
- You can write, edit and run code interactively in several common languages (Python, R, Julia, C...)
- You can easily access and run code on remote machines (with zero lag)
- You can graphically view local and remote file systems, outputs (plots etc) and files (csv, netcdf, tiff...)
- You can run code interactively using python scripts or Jupyter Notebooks
- Access to thousands of open source 'Extensions' which make coding life better!
- Seamless source control integration with Git and GitHub
- It is commonly used in industry in favour of language specific IDEs such as Spyder or RStudio
- If you have used Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder or RStudio before, it will be VERY easy to pick up.
  
### Now you're convinced, **how** can I get and run VSCode?
- Download/ load from AppsAnywhere on windows or from website for mac (should be an allowed download, if not IT would install it for you)
- You can now use vscode locally, accessing your local files, editing and running scripts.
